    title: "Simple Task Without Minimum Duration"
    requirements: |
      This is a simple task that will execute once and complete.
      No minimum duration is specified, so it follows the traditional behavior.
    
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Task is completed"
      - "Code follows conventions"

    title: "Task With Minimum Duration (Iterative)"
    requirements: |
      This task has a minimum_duration of 30 minutes.
      The orchestrator will use Claude Code's session continuity (--continue flag)
      to maintain conversation context across iterations until at least 30 minutes have elapsed.
      
      Each iteration will:
      - Continue naturally from the previous conversation
      - Build upon previous work with full context
      - Improve implementation progressively
      - Add features or enhancements iteratively
      - Refine code quality continuously
      - Enhance documentation comprehensively
    
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Feature is implemented"
      - "Code quality is high"
      - "Tests are comprehensive"
      - "Documentation is complete"
    
    # This forces iterative prompting for at least 30 minutes
    minimum_duration: 30  # minutes

    title: "Complex Refactoring With Extended Duration"
    requirements: |
      This is a complex refactoring task that benefits from
      multiple iterations of improvement.
      
      The minimum_duration of 60 minutes with session continuity ensures Claude will:
      - Maintain conversation context across all iterations
      - Thoroughly analyze the codebase with cumulative understanding
      - Implement refactoring in progressive phases
      - Continuously improve the implementation with full context
      - Add comprehensive tests building on previous iterations
      - Document changes with complete understanding of all changes
    
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Code is properly refactored"
      - "All tests pass"
      - "Performance is maintained or improved"
      - "Documentation reflects changes"
